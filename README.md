# kDrive
A React-based Cloud storage created using Google's Firebase platform for authentication and data storage. React-Bootstrap framework has been utilized for the overall design of the application.

# Installation
Simply use the command `npm install` from the root working directory to install all the dependencies for this project.

Then use the command `npm start` to start-up and deploy the project locally at https://localhost:3000.

# Implementation
A E-mail/password combination authentication system has been implemented with Firebase's Authentication functionality. Actual files/data uploaded by users are stored to Firebase storage and the relation data regarding directory data and ownership data on directories and files are stored in Firebase's Cloud Firestore.  

The UI has been created mostly with various React-Bootstrap components.
